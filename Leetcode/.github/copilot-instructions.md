When i paste the instructions from leetcode my prompt will start like this:
leetcode: example string

than you have to create a specific folder with the name of the problem in the Leetcode folder and create two files in it:

1. test.js
2. index.js
3. instructions.md

In the test.js file you have to write the multiple test cases which cover almost every possible scenario with jest for the problem and in the index.js you have to add boilerplate code for the problem I will solve the problem in the index.js file. and in the instructions.md file you have to paste the instructions from leetcode.
